## 🤝 remasters

the remakes folder has all the submods i "fixed" somehow. this fixing involves solving game breaking code, or fixing dialogue, lil mispellings or cohesion mistakes.
i'll always leave the credits for the person who actually created the submod on the rpy files, and here: (WIP)!
check this file to see all the people who wrote the code i touched/remastered so far.
